# Virtual Advisor

Stasis Theory:

A. Conjecture - Virtual Advisor for Public and Professional Writing Majors 

B. Definition - Students can become confused with major requirements or with what classes would best fit their goals - advising appointments are not efficiant for quick answers or to answer concerns

C. Quality - Allows students to have access to advising when necessary - Clear description of PPW classes - Straight forward layout of graduation requirements (Any requirements still unfulfilled will be highlighted)

D. Policy - Can be displayed on touch screens around PPW department (accessible and convenient) - Possible for use in other departments as well
